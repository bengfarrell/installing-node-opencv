instructions for installing Node OpenCV


Windows
=======

1. Download OpenCV: 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/2.3.1/OpenCV-2.3.1-win-superpack.exe/download
Extract and move files anywhere, I prefer just puttin them on my C: root in a folder called "opencv"

2. Add Environmental Variable:
Variable name: OPENCV_DIR
Variable value: C:\opencv\build\x64\vc10

(value is where you put the "opencv" folder in step 1)

3. Install Microsoft Visual Studio Express 2010
(why 2010? OpenCV 2.3.1 only has libs for 2010...vc10 is VS 2010)
